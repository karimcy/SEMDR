# DRAF Hotel Demand Response Integration - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

Successfully adapted the DRAF (Digital Refinery for Advanced Flexibility) energy optimization framework for hotel demand response applications. The integration provides minute-level time resolution, hotel-specific components, and real-time optimization capabilities suitable for automated demand response systems.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Repository Cleanup - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Streamline DRAF for hotel-scale applications while maintaining industrial backward compatibility.

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Created `hotel_components.py` with 6 hotel-specific components
- ✅ Updated component imports for clean hotel/industrial separation  
- ✅ Enhanced datetime handling for minute-level resolution (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min)
- ✅ Added rolling horizon optimization for real-time applications
- ✅ Updated frequency validation across the framework

### ✅ High-Resolution Time Series Support

**Before**: Limited to 15min, 30min, 60min frequencies
**After**: Full support for 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min frequencies

```python
# Now possible - 5-minute resolution for demand response
cs = CaseStudy(name="Hotel DR", freq="5min", year=2020)
cs.set_rolling_horizon(horizon_hours=24)  # 24-hour optimization window
```

### ✅ Hotel-Specific Component Library

Created 6 specialized components optimized for hotel applications:

1. **`HotelElectricDemand`** - Real-time demand with load shedding capability
2. **`HotelHVAC`** - Simplified HVAC with thermal mass and comfort constraints  
3. **`HotelBattery`** - Conservative battery model with cycle limits
4. **`HotelPV`** - Hotel-scale PV with roof space constraints
5. **`HotelGrid`** - TOU/RTP tariffs with demand charges
6. **`HotelMain`** - Hotel-optimized objective function and energy balances

### ✅ Demand Response Capabilities

**Load Shedding:**
- Configurable load curtailment (5-10% of demand)
- Guest comfort penalty costs
- Automatic load restoration

**HVAC Flexibility:**
- Temperature setpoint adjustment (±2-3°C)
- Pre-cooling/pre-heating optimization
- Thermal mass utilization for load shifting

**Battery Storage:**
- Peak shaving and load shifting
- Time-of-use arbitrage
- Grid service capability

### ✅ IoT Data Integration Points

Designed for seamless integration with hotel IoT systems:

```python
# Real-time demand data from smart meters
demand_data = pd.Series(iot_sensor_data, index=cs.dtindex_custom)
sc.components[0].p_el = demand_data

# Temperature sensors for HVAC optimization
temp_data = pd.Series(room_temp_sensors, index=cs.dtindex_custom)
# Occupancy sensors for comfort constraints
occupancy_data = pd.Series(occupancy_sensors, index=cs.dtindex_custom)
```
