## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. IoT Data Processing Pipeline

```python
# Real-time data fetching
demand_data = iot_manager.fetch_device_data(
    device_id="smart_meter_001",
    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=6),
    end_time=datetime.now(),
    measurement_fields=["power", "voltage", "current"]
)

# Transform to DRAF-compatible format
demand_series = SEMDRIoTIntegration.transform_iot_to_draf(
    demand_data, target_frequency="5min"
)

# Set as optimization input
sc.components[0].p_el = demand_series['power']
```

### 2. Demand Response Signal Publishing

```python
# Automated load shedding signal
iot_manager.publish_demand_response_signal(
    device_id="smart_meter_001",
    action="reduce_load",
    parameters={
        "reduction_kw": 50.0,
        "duration_minutes": 15,
        "priority": "medium"
    }
)

# HVAC setpoint adjustment
iot_manager.publish_demand_response_signal(
    device_id="hvac_zone1_temp_001",
    action="adjust_setpoint",
    parameters={
        "temperature_delta": 2.0,
        "duration_minutes": 30,
        "comfort_priority": "high"
    }
)
```

### 3. System IoT Schema Generation

```python
# Generate complete system IoT schema
system_schema = main_component.get_system_iot_schema(sc.components)

# Output includes:
# - Device schemas for all components
